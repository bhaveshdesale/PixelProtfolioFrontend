⭐ NEXT PROMPT FOR BOLT (Paste Exactly as It Is)

"I have already generated the initial website. Now I want you to completely upgrade and redesign it using the following instructions. Keep my existing structure but transform the visuals, animations, interactions, and layout. DO NOT give me a simple website; I want a premium 3D anime-themed, pixel-art-enhanced portfolio experience. Follow ALL instructions carefully:

🔥 1. Overall Theme Upgrade

Combine Death Note theme, Demon Slayer Infinity Castle aesthetics, and pixel-art styling.

Use pale, muted, anime-accurate colors — no bright neon colors.

Make the theme dark, mystical, elegant, similar to Death Note + Infinity Castle vibes.

Add soft shadows, glowing outlines, and atmospheric mist effects.

🔥 2. Intro Page (New Landing Screen)

Create a cinematic intro screen:

Title should be “Bhavesh Note” (in Death Note style typography).

Add a subtle floating 3D book model (like Death Note) using Three.js.

Add slow floating particles and mist (Infinity Castle style).

Add dark piano background music (I will replace music later; add placeholder).

Only when user clicks “Open”, it should transition to the main site with a smooth 3D door-opening animation.

🔥 3. Main Portfolio Page

After clicking "Open":

Hero Section

Show my name Bhavesh Desale in white/pale text.

Add 3D floating cube/pixel items rotating around the name.

Add subtle parallax movement on cursor.

Profile + About Section

Use placeholder pixel-art avatar (I will replace later).

Add pixel-styled borders and soft glowing edges.

Content should load one-by-one with animations, not all at once.

Skills Section

Use Infinity Castle walls pattern as a low-opacity background, not blocking text.

Add 3D tiles that flip on hover to reveal skills.

Use soft cream/gray colors, no heavy saturation.

Projects Section

Each project card is a 3D floating box that tilts when cursor moves.

Add pixel-art corner decorations.

Smooth fade-in animation for each card.

🔥 4. Pixel Assets

Use placeholder pixel art you generate internally for:

Decorative borders

Section separators

Small icons

Background overlays

I will replace these pixel assets later, so keep them modular and easy to swap.

🔥 5. Infinity Castle Visuals

Introduce Demon Slayer Infinity Castle effects:

Moving vertical light beams

Rotating perspective background shifting slowly

Reflective floor illusion

Floating lantern particles

Subtle mirror-like surfaces

All must be lightweight and optimized.

🔥 6. 3D Stack Requirement

Use Three.js + GSAP + Tailwind + Canvas/WebGL wherever needed:

Three.js → 3D objects (floating book, cubes, tiles, particles)

GSAP → smooth transitions, staggered animations

WebGL → depth, blur, atmospheric effects

Tailwind → clean responsive styling

Ensure all 3D content is FPS optimized.

🔥 7. Loading & Interaction Animations

Content loads progressively, not all at once.

On cursor move →

3D objects react

Shadows shift

Pixel particles move slightly

Smooth fade-in + parallax on scroll.

Use GSAP stagger timing for section entries.

🔥 8. Responsive Design

Website must be fully responsive:

Mobile vertical layout

Adjust 3D objects for small screens

Reduce particle count for performance

Pixel art must stay crisp (no blurring)

🔥 9. Additional Features

Add these features to the upgraded site:

⭐ Death Note Music Integration

Add audio player with toggle

Autoplay only after user interacts

I will replace the soundtrack later

⭐ Light/Dark Theme Switch

Dark theme = default (Death Note style)

Light theme = pale parchment colors

Switch must also recolor pixel assets and 3D elements

⭐ Visitor Counter

Add a small, stylish visitor count badge at the footer:

Use local storage + simple API simulation

Should look like a mystical number counter

Fit theme perfectly

🔥 10. What You Deliver

You must deliver:

Full upgraded HTML + CSS + JS files

Three.js scenes

GSAP animations

Pixel placeholders

Infinity Castle effects

Bhavesh Note intro screen

Fully responsive UI

Full code ready to run on Replit (No errors!)

This should NOT look like a basic website.
This must look premium, anime-cinematic, 3D, and pixel-art infused.

Follow all instructions EXACTLY."**

🎉 DONE

Paste the entire prompt above into Bolt/Replit and it will generate the upgraded version.

🔮 Want Suggestions for Next Level Features?

Here are some cool ideas:

✔ Add L & Ryuk shadows appearing randomly
✔ Add 3D Infinity Castle rooms users can explore
✔ Add pixel versions of you walking around the site
✔ Add “Write your name in Bhavesh Note” Easter Egg
✔ Add typing animation like Light’s handwriting
✔ Add Demon Slayer BGM toggle
✔ Make the website load like anime opening sequence

If you want, I can write the next-level prompt for adding all these features too.
