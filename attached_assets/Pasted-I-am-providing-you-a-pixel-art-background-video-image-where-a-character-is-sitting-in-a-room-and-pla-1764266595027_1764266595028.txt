I am providing you a pixel-art background video/image where a character is sitting in a room and playing a video game on a TV.  
Study the layout carefully. You must implement the following changes exactly:

1) On the RIGHT-SIDE TV screen in the image, add a fully responsive component that perfectly covers the entire TV area.  
   - It should blend naturally with the TV border (not shiny, not AI-looking).  
   - It should feel like part of the original pixel image.  
   - The TV component must be clickable.

2) When the user CLICKS on the TV:
   - Play a quick "anime flash-in / flash-out" effect (2D or pixel-FX style).  
   - After the transition, open a MINI-WEBSITE overlay (full screen).  
   - This mini-website should contain 3–4 CARDS only:
        • Each card = one mystery puzzle or mini-game.  
        • Only show: pixel image + the name of the game/puzzle. No text, no description.  
   - When the user clicks on a card → open that puzzle/game in a new inner page/modal.

3) Requirements for design:
   - Keep pure pixel-art aesthetics.  
   - Match colors with the provided background video.  
   - No neon/glow, no AI shine.  
   - Everything should look manually designed, cohesive, and retro.

4) Technical instructions:
   - Use Next.js + Three.js (if needed for effects).  
   - The TV component should animate on hover with a subtle pixel shimmer.  
   - The anime flash effect must be fast (300–500ms) and pixel-styled.  
   - The mini-website overlay must fade/slide in aesthetically.  
   - Make the TV click-interaction fully responsive on both desktop and mobile.

5) Implementation details:
   - Detect the exact TV frame coordinates from the provided image/video and align the component perfectly so it looks like part of the TV.  
   - The clickable area should fully replace the original static TV scene visually.  
   - The mini-website must include:
        • Pixel background  
        • Pixel font  
        • Retro cursor  
        • Smooth transitions  
   - No loading screens.  
   - Preload everything in background.

6) Output:
   - Update all necessary components/pages.  
   - Provide clean, modular Next.js components for:
        • TVInteraction.tsx  
        • AnimeFlashEffect.tsx  
        • MiniGameHub.tsx  
        • GameCard.tsx  
        • IndividualGamePage.tsx  
   - Ensure the final result feels like a hidden "easter egg" on the website.

This is a strict request. Do not simplify.  
Integrate the new feature exactly inside the provided image’s TV region.
