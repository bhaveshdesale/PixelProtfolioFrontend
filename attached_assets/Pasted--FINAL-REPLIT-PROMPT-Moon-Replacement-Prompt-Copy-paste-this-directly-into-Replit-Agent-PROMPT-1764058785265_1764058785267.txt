✅ FINAL REPLIT PROMPT (Moon Replacement Prompt)

Copy-paste this directly into Replit Agent:

PROMPT START

I have uploaded a pixel-based background video/image. In the background there is an existing moon (the one inside the red-circled area). I want you to remove or hide the original moon completely and replace it with my own custom moon component.

🔧 Requirements:

Replace the existing moon positioned in the top-right window area with my own moon component.

My moon component must perfectly overlap the old moon location.

It must blend into the pixel-art background, look natural, and feel like it was originally part of the art.

DO NOT make it bright, glowing, shiny, or highlighted.

It should look subtle, muted, and “hidden” so users discover it slowly.

The original moon in the background should no longer be visible.

Either hide it using CSS masking/overlay

OR place my custom moon component exactly on top of it so it fully covers it.

Positioning rules for my moon component:

Fit inside the window frame exactly as shown in the screenshot.

The size must be the same proportion as the original moon.

Use pixel-perfect alignment so it looks like part of the wallpaper.

No weird borders, blurs, or scaling issues.

Behavior rules:

My moon component should NOT float, animate, or glow.

No hover effects unless I request later.

It must visually integrate with the background.

Code implementation rules:

Adjust the component’s CSS position, top, right, transform, and z-index so it sits exactly in place.

You can use absolute positioning relative to the HeroSection parent.

Make sure the moon stays responsive and positioned correctly on desktop and mobile.

Do not break the current layout.

IMPORTANT:
The final result should look like the moon was drawn as part of the original pixel-art image — not like a button or icon placed on top.

📌 Target File

The moon toggle component is currently located here:
/components/MusicToggle.tsx (or /components/ThemeToggle.tsx depending on code)

Replace the red-circled moon section of the background with my new moon component by adjusting whichever file controls that layout.

📄 Reference Screenshot

Use this screenshot as reference and replace the moon exactly where the red mark is:

FILE PATH:
/mnt/data/546845e5-7788-4646-818c-eb42e0781853.png

Load this file to see where the moon is located and replace it accordingly.

After doing these adjustments, provide me with the updated code and confirm that the moon blends perfectly into the pixel-art scene.
