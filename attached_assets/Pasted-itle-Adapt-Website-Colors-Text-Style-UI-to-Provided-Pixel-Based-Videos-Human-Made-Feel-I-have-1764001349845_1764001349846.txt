itle: Adapt Website Colors, Text Style & UI to Provided Pixel-Based Videos (Human-Made Feel)

I have now uploaded pixel-based videos for each section of my anime portfolio website.
Your task is to adapt the entire website’s UI, color palette, fonts, and layout according to each specific video’s color scheme.

🔥 Core Requirements

Use the colors directly from each video to set:

Section background tones

Text colors

Highlight colors

Button colors

Card colors
Do NOT use bright or shiny colors.
Use soft, pale, muted, theme-matching tones so the site looks hand-crafted, not AI-generated.

Ensure pixel-video visibility

Text must never clash with the videos.

Avoid overlapping elements.

Add subtle shadows / semi-transparent overlays ONLY when needed for readability.

Keep the vibe clean and intentional.

Keep the website’s overall themes intact

Death Note (Bhavesh Note) opening page

Infinity Castle (Demon Slayer) aesthetic for transitions & sections

Pixel-style animations and elements remain

Make sure the new colors blend with these themes

No shiny or neon look

The site must feel human-made

Use minimalist, anime-inspired pale color palettes

Prefer matte finishes, low-contrast gradients, grainy textures when needed

Do NOT alter the layout structure drastically
Only change:

Colors

Font themes

Borders

Shadows

Overlays

Backgrounds
according to the videos I provided.

Fonts

Use clean anime-inspired serif or soft-rounded sans-serif

Avoid futuristic neon fonts

Make sure text remains readable over videos

Responsiveness

Re-test mobile and desktop views after applying video-based colors

Ensure pixel videos scale smoothly

Ensure text automatically adjusts for contrast based on background frame

🎯 Goal

Make the website look like a ** handcrafted anime-pixel portfolio ** where:

Colors feel natural

Videos define the aesthetic

Text blends perfectly

Nothing looks AI-generated or overly polished

If you need the full combined prompt (from start to end), I can give that too, but this is the next step prompt based only on your latest requirement.

If you want, I can also make:
✔ A version for 3D frameworks like Three.js
✔ A version for GSAP scroll animations
✔ A version for adding ambient anime music
✔ A version for theme toggle (Light / Dark / “Shinigami Mode”)
