1. REMOVE the current loader completely

Delete my old Loader component and replace it with a name-reveal intro animation exactly like the animation shown in my reference video (the video I will upload).

Expected behavior:

When the user opens the website:

Instead of showing the loader,

A pixel-style animated name reveal should play.

The animation should reveal my name exactly like the reference video:

Pixel fade-in, pixel build-up, or drawing animation

Timing and pacing should match the reference video exactly.

My full name must reveal in this exact format:
“BHAVESH DESALE”

After the name animation fully completes:

The homepage should automatically fade-in.

No scrolling should be possible during animation.

No other UI should be visible until the animation finishes.

Important Styling Notes:

Use pixel-based typography (8-bit retro style).

Avoid shiny/glossy AI-looking effects.

Style should match the pixel videos I will provide.

Keep colors muted, pale, and aesthetic — not bright.

🎨 2. This animation must look 100% hand-crafted (not AI-generated)

Keep the colors consistent with the pixel videos.

Do NOT use bright neon colors.

Background behind the name should be:

Subtle pixel-noise,

Or a static frame extracted from my provided videos.

⚙️ 3. Technical requirements

Implement the animation using one of the following (whichever fits best):

Framer Motion

GSAP

Lottie with a JSON animation

Canvas animation

Three.js Sprite animation

Any method is fine as long as it matches the reference animation exactly.

Additional requirements:

Animation must be smooth at 60fps.

It must be mobile responsive.

Do not preload the entire website at once.

Only the home section loads after animation finishes.

🧱 4. Component placement

Insert this new intro animation before the following components:

<Navigation />
<HeroSection />
<AboutSection />
<SkillsSection />
<InternshipSection />
<ProjectsSection />
<ClubsAppSection />
<ContactSection />
<Footer />
<FloatingPixelObjects />
<MusicToggle />
<ParticleSystem />


Homepage loads ONLY after animation completes.

🪄 5. Logic flow
Flow that must happen:

User opens website

Pixel-name animation starts

“BHAVESH DESALE” fully reveals

Animation holds for 0.5–1 second

Smooth fade transition

Homepage appears

Everything else works normally

📌 6. Do NOT modify any other design except where necessary

DO NOT change pixel videos.

DO NOT change backgrounds.

DO NOT change the website theme.

Only adapt typography and font colors to match the background videos I will provide.

🎯 7. When implementing, ensure these rules:

Keep the animation short (1.5–3 seconds).

Use pixel-art easing styles (no modern smooth bezier curves).

Use muted colors only.

No extra glowing or shiny effects.

Make sure it looks handmade, subtle, anime-pixel themed.

📥 8. I will upload the reference video

Once uploaded:

Extract animation style

Match timing

Match reveal effect

Reproduce EXACTLY

Apply to “BHAVESH DESALE”
