📌 START OF PROMPT

Build me a stunning, high-quality, anime-themed + pixel-art portfolio website with a 3D design style.
This website must NOT look AI-generated — it should feel hand-crafted, premium, and clean.
Use subtle pale, muted color palettes (NO bright colors).
Maintain perfect readability and layout even with pixel objects present.

🎌 1. THEME + AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS
Anime Themes to Combine

Death Note Theme (but rename it to something original such as “Bhavesh Note” or “Desale Note”)

Demon Slayer Infinity Castle Theme (floating rooms, infinite halls, glowing pale red/purple tones)

Pixel Art Theme (retro pixel environment blended with modern anime)

Overall Style

Dark + pale color scheme

Soft glows, shadows, atmospheric feel

Crisp typography

Pixel-art characters, objects, borders (temporary placeholders—replaceable later)

Smooth animations based on:

floating 3D objects

slow parallax motion

scene transitions inspired by anime opening sequences

The website must feel like:
“Death Note × Infinity Castle × Pixel Art × Modern 3D Portfolio.”

🔮 2. WEBSITE ENTRY EXPERIENCE (FIRST SCREEN)
Landing Screen Requirements

Entire screen themed as Death Note title page, but renamed to:
"Bhavesh Note"

Elegant handwritten gothic typeface

Pale white-on-black palette

A subtle falling feather or floating dust particle animation

One central anime-style notebook that opens on click

Click Interaction

When the user clicks the notebook:
➡ Transition into the main portfolio homepage with a smooth anime-like zoom-in + fade transition
➡ Add a soft audio cue (a light Death Note-style piano note)

🧑‍💻 3. MAIN HOMEPAGE CONTENT

Clubs App Section

Present my real project with:

🧭 5. RESPONSIVENESS

The website MUST be fully responsive:

Mobile → custom layout with stacked sections

Tablet → optimized 2-column areas

Desktop → full 3D + animations mode

All pixel art must remain visible and NOT block readability

Elements should automatically rearrange for perfect visibility

🧱 6. 3D IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

Use a proper 3D setup (Bolt AI can generate the HTML/CSS/JS):

Use Three.js or equivalent

Use subtle:

parallax

depth layers

floating objects

rotating pixel cubes

No heavy performance load

Everything must blend visually with anime + pixel + Infinity Castle themes

🎵 7. ANIME MUSIC INTEGRATION

Add background music with:

Soft instrumental Death Note-style track

Auto-starts muted

User can toggle sound on/off with a floating pixel-style music icon

Must NOT autoplay with volume (only mute → unmute allowed)

🌙 8. LIGHT + DARK MODE

Include a theme toggle:

Dark mode → default (anime-friendly)

Light mode → pale color palette (NOT bright)

Pixel objects recolor automatically

Background animations adjust for visibility

🔢 9. VISITOR COUNTER

Include a real-time visitor counter:

Animated pixel-style number roll

Positioned in footer

“Visited by X anime travelers so far”

Use any API or simple local storage fallback

🧱 10. SPECIAL BEHAVIOR FOR FUTURE UPDATES

I will later upload:

my own pixel images

pixel videos

Infinity Castle scene renders

So structure the site so that:

All images and videos are modular components

Easy to replace assets

Clear folder organization

No hard-coded pixel art

No bright colors allowed

Smooth transition animations between replaced assets

🎯 11. IMPORTANT FINAL RULES

The website MUST NOT look AI-generated.

Keep everything premium, neat, anime-inspired.

Use only pale color tones + dark modes.

Ensure all sections blend cleanly with pixel + anime style.

Follow a carefully handcrafted aesthetic.

Make the website feel like an interactive anime world with pixel hints.

Full clean code and folder structure.

Add proper animations and transitions.
